    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Ginger Miso Udon Noodles</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced ginger</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons white/yellow miso paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>7 cups vegetable broth</li>
      <li>4-inch piece of kombu (optional)</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>8 ounces dry udon noodles (see note 1)</li>
      <li>6 ounces bok choy, trimmed and rinsed</li>
      <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and julienned</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Five-Spice Tofu</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (14-ounce) package extra-firm tofu</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Garnish</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>sliced scallions</li>
      <li>black sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Make the Broth</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a pot, add 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil and heat the pot over
        medium heat. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.
        Add the miso paste and stir the paste constantly until the paste is no
        longer lumpy. A few tiny lumps is okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the coriander, vegetable broth, and kombu, if using. Cover the pot,
        increase the heat to medium-high, and bring the broth to boil. Right
        before the broth boils, remove the kombu from the pot. It releases a
        bitter flavor when overcooked. Reduce the heat to low and let the broth
        simmer as you finish cooking the other ingredients.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook the Tofu</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Drain the tofu. Slice the tofu block in half, crosswise, so that you
        have 2 short and thick rectangles. Cut each half into 4 slices,
        crosswise, so that you will end up with 8 small rectangles. Slice each
        rectangle on the diagonal so that you end up with 16 rectangles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the soy sauce with the five-spice powder and pour it over a
        non-stick pan. Take a piece of the tofu, and drag it around the soy
        sauce mixture. Flip the tofu over to cover all sides with soy sauce and
        leave the piece of tofu in the pan. Continue with the remaining pieces
        of tofu, until all the soy sauce has been absorbed by the tofu, and all
        the pieces are in the pan. Fry the tofu over medium heat for about 4
        minutes, flipping halfway. Itâ€™s perfectly fine if the pan is dry at this
        point. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan, and continue cooking the tofu
        for another 3 to 4 minutes, flipping it halfway.
      </li>
      <li>Turn off the heat and leave the tofu on the pan.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cook the Noodles and Vegetables</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to boil. Add the dried
        noodles to the boiling water and cook according to package instructions.
        The noodles I used required about 6 minutes of cooking. Once the noodles
        are cooked, drain the noodles and run them under cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the broth and add more salt, to taste. Raise the heat to
        medium-high and bring the broth to boil again. Add the bok choy and cook
        it for about 2 minutes, until green parts of the bok choy are vibrant
        green. If you want to cook the carrots, add them along with the bok
        choy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the noodles in bowls and ladle broth over the noodles. Top with
        the vegetables and tofu, and garnish with scallions and sesame seeds.
        Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You might also see vacuum-sealed, slightly cooked udon noodles in the
        stores. If you are using those udon noodles, use 3 small packages of
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        This recipe is meant to serve 2 people with 1 serving for leftovers. If
        you want this to serve 4 people, I would add another 2 to 4 ounces of
        dried noodles and another cup or two of broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is often a lot of dirt stuck around the stem of bok choy. Be sure
        to rinse the vegetables several times to get rid of the dirt.
      </li>
    </ol>
